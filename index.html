<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p> I am a computer engineer fascinated with math, theorem provers, type theory, and logic.
  I like to code in Agda, Lean, and Idris.
  And after more than a year studying cubical type theory and theorem provers,
  I decided to create this blog to share my ideas and thoughts. </p>
